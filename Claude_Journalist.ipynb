Habeck said the government now anticipates German GDP to increase by 1% in 2025.\\n\\nSpeaking during a news briefing, the minister attributed the revised forecast to an unstable global economic environment and to the low growth of world trade, alongside higher interest rates.\\n\\nThose issues have negatively impacted investments, especially in the construction industry, he said.\\n\\nGerman housebuilding is among the sectors that have been most affected by this, with developers canceling projects and order numbers declining, according to recent data.

Why is the index doing so well despite the struggling German economy and what are the latest DAX 40 forecasts and price predictions for 2024 and beyond?\\n\\nThe German stock market benchmark index has gained 20% since November 2023, surging past the 16,500-point mark, a level last witnessed in early August 2023. This performance ranks as the second-best annual showing in the past decade.\\n\\nThe German stock market, known as the DAX 40, has been doing surprisingly well even though the country\\'s economy is struggling. This is good news for investors, but there are some worries about the overall economic outlook. While jobless data is slightly better than forecast and inflation is coming down, weak retail sales add to the questions about the DAX.\\n\\nDAX 40 Forecast & Price Predictions – Key Takeaways DAX 40 forecast today : The Dax continues to consolidate around 17,000 but remains above trendline support from the October low. In the short term, a push to a fresh record high seems likely.\\n\\n: The Dax continues to consolidate around 17,000 but remains above trendline support from the October low.

However, they warn that it\\'s important for the DAX to stay above the 16,800-point mark to keep going up.\\n\\n: Most of the experts are forecasting DAX index to reach 17,500 points by the end of the year. However, they warn that it\\'s important for the DAX to stay above the 16,800-point mark to keep going up. DAX 40 Forecast for the next 5 years: According to analysts, the bull market will continue within the next few years, but periodic downturns in business activity may bring corrections. The index could break the 20,000 points mark.\\n\\nDAX 40 Outlook - What\\'s behind the German stock market gains?\\n\\nTo get a better understanding of how well the DAX is doing, we looked at how many companies in the German stock market were doing better than usual. We found that 26 out of the 40 companies were doing well, which is a good sign. However, the volatility index, which measures how much the stock market is changing, is going up. This could mean that things will be more unpredictable in the future, and the stock market might go down instead of up.\\n\\nProminent contributors to this recent surge include Infineon Technologies AG, Siemens Energy AG, and Sartorius, all recording gains over the last months of 2023 – the beginning of 2024. Notably, positive gains have been widespread across the DAX components, with only three companies reporting a negative monthly performance.\\n\\nThis remarkable rally in the DAX index is occurring despite less favorable economic data for Germany, which may already be on the verge of, if not already in, a contraction phase. Rising expectations of European Central Bank (ECB) rate cuts, as Euronews recently highlighted, and a substantial decline in oil and natural gas prices have been the two primary factors propelling German equities lately.\\n\\nECB rate cuts in 2024\\n\\nThe recent disinflation within the eurozone has fueled hopes that the ECB will initiate rate cuts in the coming year. Money markets indicate that investors are pricing in 137 basis points of cuts through December 2024, implying five interest-rate reductions of 25 basis points, with the first expected in either March or April 2024.\\n\\nAs a result of this notable change in ECB rate forecasts, bond rates have decreased throughout the eurozone. German bond yields just last week fell to a six-month low of 2.17% on December 7, then somewhat increased to the current 2.26%. This rate offers German firms much-needed relief in the form of more feasible refinancing plans for their maturing debts, as it is significantly lower than the 3% level noted in October.\\n\\nLower energy prices\\n\\nThe significant decline in energy prices has been another important driver of German stock market success that has set records. The nation\\'s transition strategy towards renewable energy sources by 2030, known as the \"Energiewende,\" has Germany firmly committed to this goal, although purchasing fossil fuels still costs German firms a lot of money.\\n\\nPositively, the recent sharp drops in the price of natural gas and oil have provided respite to Germany\\'s energy-intensive industries and automakers. The price of Brent crude oil has decreased by 20% since the end of September, while the Dutch TTF benchmark\\'s tracking of European petrol prices has seen a sharp decline of 35% since the end of October and more than 70% since the same time last year.\\n\\nDAX 40 Forecast - What could happen next?\\n\\nDespite numerous geopolitical conflicts and weak economic outlooks, stock market experts hold a cautiously optimistic view concerning the future of the German stock market. They expect the Dax to trade between 15,500 points and 17,500 points.\\n\\nDZ Bank - DAX forecasted to reach 17,500 points\\n\\nAccording to a special DZ BANK survey, almost 50 percent of SMEs see Germany as the \"sick man\" of Europe. This is mainly due to expensive energy and an overburdening bureaucracy. Added to this are economic concerns. \"We only expect an increase of 0.5% for 2024,\" explains Michael Holstein. He attributes the low growth to the continued tense global economy - strong export business at pre-corona levels is therefore unlikely. There is also a weak propensity to buy among consumers.\\n\\nChief equity strategist Sven Streibel nevertheless expects new records for the major indices. \"Investor sentiment is at its lowest point. If the bad news clears up just a little, there is enormous potential for positive surprises. This speaks for favourable European cyclicals. He forecasts 17,500 points for the DAX by the end of the year.\\n\\nLandesbank Baden-Württemberg forecast DAX index could climb to 17,500 points in 2024\\n\\nLandesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW), forecasted the Dax 40 index to reach 17,500 points by the end of the year. The Head of the Research Group for Private and Corporate Customers does not expect a strong year-end rally because investors, at best, have only small profit margins on their positions which they have acquired throughout the year, and will act cautiously until the end.\\n\\nHe believes that stock prices, especially for the local stock market, have more potential in the upcoming year. By the middle of the year, according to Fernow, the central banks will begin to loosen monetary restrictions. \"This should also have an impact on the long end of the capital market, making stocks more attractive compared to bonds,\" says the analyst. Now, stock risks are under-compensated, particularly in the US.\\n\\nDeka Bank forecasted DAX 40 will trade at 17,500 points by the end of the year\\n\\nJoachim Schallmayer, Head of Capital Markets and Strategy at DekaBank, predicts that the German stock index will reach 17,500 points by the end of the year.\\n\\nAccording to him, the global economy appears stable, albeit not very dynamic. The same applies to corporate earnings, even though the energy sector significantly weighed down third-quarter results. Inflation continues to decline, and core rates, excluding the highly volatile energy and food prices, are anticipated to decrease significantly in the fourth quarter and the next year.\\n\\nSchallmayer expects stocks to move moderately upward with fluctuations. Therefore, he emphasizes the importance of regular and countercyclical investing, as well as dividend collection.\\n\\nIG.com - DAX forecasted to stay above the 16,800 mark for a long\\n\\nIG\\'s analysts think that the DAX could go up again soon. They estimate that it could go as high as 17,500 points in the first half of the year. But they warn that it\\'s important for the DAX to stay above the 16,800-point mark to keep going up.\\n\\nThe German economy has always been one of the strongest in Europe. The European Central Bank, which makes decisions about money, usually keeps interest rates low to help the German economy. Analysts think that if the bank lowers interest rates even more, it would help the DAX and the rest of the German stock market. However, they also say that there are some challenges for the bank, like worries about inflation, or prices going up too much.\\n\\nDAX 40 Analysis - What are charts saying?\\n\\nOn the DAX chart, we can track the time of the first cut for each of those three cycles that have been shown since the year 2000. It’s the 2011 instance that’s of interest, as this was a moderate series of cuts and given the pattern with which those cuts priced in, as opposed to the emergency actions of 2001 or 2008. Slow, steady, and methodical cuts can possibly be absorbed by the financial system without significant unrest. But fast and aggressive cuts can quickly trigger a bull market in bonds and if capital begins to leave the equity space, a new theme can quickly develop, much as we saw in those two earlier instances.\\n\\nFibonacci extension near 17,500 which is close to the current price: after which another spot shows around the 19k level. However, a drop toward the 16,500 levels could set up a double top pattern , a bearish reversal chart pattern that will signal a correction targeting the 16,000 points area.\\n\\nIf the ECB can cut rates slowly in 2024, without any abrupt emergency actions, that 17,500 level DAX price prediction coming from most the experts, could very much be attainable.\\n\\nDAX 40 Price Predictions from AI-based Websites\\n\\nAccording to Trading Economics’ DAX 40 forecast 2024, as of February, the index was expected to trade at 16744.05 points by the end of the quarter and at 16152.64 points in 12 months’ time. The agency does not make a DAX 40 forecast for 2025 and 2030.\\n\\nGov Capital\\'s DAX 40 forecast 2024, as of February, shows one of the most bullish DAX price predictions among AI-based websites, with the index expected to trade as high as 19,000 points by the end of the year. Furthermore, the DAX is forecasted to trade at 30,000 by the end of 2025. The DAX 40 forecast for the next 5 years seems way too optimistic, with the index expected to reach the 100,000-price level.\\n\\nOn the Wallet Investor website, we can find the DAX 40 price predictions for 2024, 2025, and the next 5 years. DAX 40 is forecasted to reach a maximum price of 17,622 during the year. The 2025 DAX 40 price prediction is flat, while the DAX index forecast for the next 5 years is slightly bullish, with the index expected to trade above 20,000 points.\\n\\nBefore making trading decisions, always keep in mind that predictions from algorithm-based forecasting services and analysts can sometimes be wrong. Their forecasts are based on past trends and might not consider many other facts that can affect the market. You should always do your own research to form an outlook for the DAX 40 index.\\n\\nWhat is DAX 40?\\n\\nDAX is short for Deutscher Aktien Index 40 and tracks the 40 largest German companies in terms of market cap and liquidity. It was established with a base value of 1,000 in 1988 and since 2006, the Xetra trading venue has been computing the index’s price every second.\\n\\nWhen the DAX 30 became the DAX 40 in September 2021, the Deutsch Boerse admitted ten more companies to the index, meaning a slightly broader range of sectors covered, as well as other regulatory provisions. The DAX 30 became the DAX 40 on 20 September 2021.\\n\\nSince its inception at the end of 1987, the DAX has mirrored other indices during major economic events throughout history, including the tech bubble in 2000, significant lows in 2003, as well as other fluctuations over in subsequent years. The index plunged in 2008 amid the global financial crisis and did so again during the global COVID-19 outbreak.\\n\\nHow Is the DAX Index Calculated?\\n\\nThe DAX 40 is computed through the free-float methodology, which means that it takes into consideration only the readily available shares and it doesn’t consider shares that are untradable, like those owned by governments.\\n\\n\\n\\nLike other blue-chip indices, the DAX Index is also weighted by market cap, so companies with higher market caps have more influence on its value. Companies included in the DAX can have a maximum weight of 10%.\\n\\nHow to forecast the DAX 40 index?\\n\\nThe DAX 40 has an inverse correlation of 70% with the Euro and a positive correlation of 90% with the main US stock indices, according to Blackwell Global. The relationship between the DAX and its US counterparts has occasionally diverged; in 2018, for instance, the 50-day correlation between the two moved negative, suggesting a brief shift in the fundamental patterns impacting global assets.\\n\\nFor example, when the EUR/USD currency pair rises, the DAX index typically falls; conversely, when the Euro falls vs the USD, the DAX rises. Traders utilize this correlation to create reliable trading strategies. However, keep in mind that correlations sometimes can fade unexpectedly.\\n\\nThe DAX is very sensitive to the policies of the European Central Bank, or ECB, which is another fascinating fact. The index is probably going to be impacted by major news releases in the Eurozone. This is so that you can reduce risk since you\\'re basing decisions on accurate information when using the correlation technique to forecast the DAX 40 index.\\n\\nHow to trade DAX 40?\\n\\nContract for Difference (CFDs) is one of the ways you can trade the DAX cost-effectively and efficiently. Generally, online brokers offer a CFD based on the cash index (GER30) and a CFD based on the underlying futures contract (DAX30.fs).\\n\\nWhen you trade indices online using CFDs, you can speculate on the direction of the underlying instrument (the DAX) without owning it or any of its constituents. You can make use of leverage and you will have the ability to go both long and short. However, remember that leverage can magnify both profit and losses. Make sure you are aware of the risks of CFD trading.\\n\\nCFD trading can prove especially useful during a downturn. Most investors want to avoid a reshuffling of their portfolio as the costs can quickly add up and it is incredibly difficult to time the market correctly. Therefore, instead of selling a large part of your portfolio when you anticipate a correction, you could use CFDs to speculate on falling prices.\\n\\nWhat are the DAX trading hours?\\n\\nThe DAX market hours are from 9 AM to 5:30 PM (Central European Time). Out-of-hours trading occurs from 5:30 PM to 10:00 PM and from 08:00 to 09:00.\\n\\nThe Dax Futures contract on the EUREX exchange is traded from 01:10 to 22:00 (Central European Time). The Cash CFD - GER30 - can be traded from 18:00 Sunday to 16:59 Friday (New York Time) with a daily trading break from 16:59 - 18:00 (New York Time).\\n\\nWhen trading the DAX 40, you should always be aware of market holidays, as these days usually see less liquidity and less trading volume.\\n\\nConsider the following: Good Friday, Easter Monday, Labor Day, Ascension Day, Whit Monday, Corpus Christi, German Unity Day, Christmas and Boxing Day, and remember that while some holidays will only be observed by German traders, others might be followed by different traders around the world.\\n\\nExplore our Germany 40 CFDs On our trading platform, we offer a derivative version of the DAX index to trade called the Germany 40.

Learn more\\n\\nWhat are the most popular DAX 40 trading strategies?\\n\\nDay trading (including scalping technique) and swing trading are among the most popular trading styles used to actively trade the DAX 40 over the short to medium term. While you will keep your positions open for a few hours with day trading, you can hold them from a few days to a few weeks with swing trading.\\n\\n\\n\\nUsually, active traders rely on technical analysis to decide when to enter or exit the market. They can use breakout trading to spot when the German index breaks out above a resistance level or below a support level to open a position and take advantage of the strong price movement.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut they can also use other strategies, such as mean reversion trading, which is used to determine any overbought or oversold conditions that can trigger a price reversal, pushing the index to return to its mean.\\n\\nNews trading is also very popular when trading the DAX 40, such as when economic and geopolitical news that may impact the German economy are published.\\n\\nIf your time horizon is a bit longer than a day, you can also use a trend-following strategy to trade in the direction of the primary trend and ride the bullish or bearish momentum. This is called position trading and takes into consideration the fundamental outlook.\\n\\nHow to invest in DAX 40?\\n\\nFirst is to try to replicate the index yourself, in a process known as indexing. This way, you can create your own portfolio of securities that best represents the DAX 40 index. The stocks and the weightings of your allocations would be the same as in the actual index, and the information about index components and their percentage weights is publicly available on several financial or investing websites.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdjustments would have to be made periodically to reflect changes in the index. This stock investing method can be quite costly since it requires an investor to create an extensive portfolio and make hundreds of transactions a year.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are the most popular way to invest in the German index. It is more cost-effective than buying shares and the rebalancing is done frequently.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe largest DAX ETFs are:\\n\\niShares Core DAX UCITS ETF\\n\\nXtrackers DAX UCITS ETF\\n\\nDeka DAX UCITS ETF\\n\\nThe DAX ETFs with the lowest expense ratio are:\\n\\nLyxor Core DAX\\n\\nXTrackers UCITS ETF\\n\\nXtraders DAX UCITS ETF Income\\n\\nMost DAX ETFs are similar and essentially just track the performance of the index. When comparing the different ETFs, investors usually look at the total expense ratio (TER) - i.e. how much it will cost to hold the ETF - as well as how much money the ETF has under management and where it is domiciled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplore our German stocks and ETFs Our WebTrader platform and app offers the most important stocks listed on the German stock exchange as well as several ETFs that track the performance of the underlying Germany 40 index.

I want to welcome everyone, good morning. Also hello to those who are joining us online. I am Jose Luis De Haro with the Communications Department here at the IMF. We are gathered here today to introduce the latest edition of the World Economic Outlook. If you have not got a copy yet, I would recommend you go to IMF.org. There you will find the flagship. Then also there is a blog and data underlining some charts and many other assets that might be helpful for your reporting.\\n\\nAnd what best to discuss the World Economic Outlook than to be here today with Pierre‑Olivier Gourinchas. He is the Economic Counsellor and the Director of the Research Department. Also next to him are Petya Koeva Brooks, Deputy Director, and Daniel Leigh, Division Chief, also with Research Department.\\n\\nPierre‑Olivier is going to start with some opening remarks, and then we are going to proceed to take your questions. I want to remind everyone that this briefing is on the record and that we also have simultaneous interpretation. With that, Pierre‑Olivier, the floor is yours.\\n\\nMr. Gourinchas: Thank you, Jose. Good morning, everyone. The global economy continues to display remarkable resilience with growth holding steady and inflation declining, but many challenges still lie ahead. Global growth was 3.2 percent in 2023 and is expected to remain at that level both in 2024 and 2025. This represents a 0.3 percentage point upgrade from our October objections for 2024, with stronger activity than expected in the U.S., China, and other large emerging markets, but weaker activity in the Euro Area.\\n\\nInflation continues to come down. Median inflation will decline from 4 percent at the end of last year to 2.8 percent by the end of this year and 2.4 percent at the end of 2025, and most indicators continue to point to a soft landing.\\n\\nA resilient growth and rapid disinflation are consistent with favorable supply developments, including the fading of energy price shocks and a striking rebound in labor supply, supported by strong immigration in many advanced economies.\\n\\nWe also project less economic scarring from the crisis of the past 4 years, although estimates vary across countries. The U.S. economy has already surged past its pre‑pandemic trend, but we now estimate there will be more scarring for low‑income developing countries, many of which are still struggling to turn the page from the pandemic and cost‑of‑living crisis.\\n\\nRisks are now broadly balanced. On the downside, new price spikes from geopolitical tensions, persistent core inflation, or a disruptive turn towards a fiscal adjustment could slow activity. On the upside, faster disinflation or timely structural reforms that boost productivity could support activity. Insufficient action on the fiscal front could also stimulate growth, although this could force a more costlier adjustment later on.\\n\\nInflation trends are encouraging, but we are not there yet. Somewhat worryingly, progress towards inflation targets has stalled since the beginning of the year in some countries. This could be a temporary setback, but there are reasons to remain vigilant. Oil prices have been rising in part due to geopolitical tensions and services inflation remains stubbornly high in many countries. Further trade restrictions could also push up goods inflation. Bringing inflation back to target should remain the priority. There are stark divergences also between countries that call for careful calibration of monetary policy. The strong recent performance of the United States reflects robust productivity growth and growth in labor supply, but also strong demand pressures that could add to inflation. This calls for a cautious and gradual approach to easing by the Federal Reserve.\\n\\nBy contrast, growth in the Euro Area will rebound this year but from very low levels. Unlike in the United States, there is little evidence of a hot economy, and the European Central Bank will need to carefully calibrate the pivot towards monetary easing.\\n\\nChina’s economy remains affected by the downturn in its property sector. Domestic demand will remain lackluster unless strong measures address the root cause and monetary policy can afford to be more accommodative.\\n\\nGoing forward, policymakers should prioritize measures that help preserve or even enhance the resilience of the global economy. A key priority is to rebuild fiscal buffers, especially in an environment with high real interest rates, modest growth, and elevated debts. Unfortunately planned fiscal adjustments are often insufficient and could be derailed further given the record number of elections this year.\\n\\nIn the United States, the fiscal stance is out of line with long‑term fiscal sustainability. This raises short‑term risks to the disinflation process, as well as longer‑term fiscal and financial stability risks for the global economy. Fiscal consolidations are never easy, but it is best not to wait until market dictate their conditions.\\n\\nCredible fiscal consolidations can help lower funding costs, improve fiscal headroom and financial stability. The key is to start early, gradually, and credibly. This will also pave the way for further monetary policy easing to support activity.\\n\\nThe second priority is to reverse the decline in medium‑term growth for low‑income countries. Structural reforms should promote domestic and foreign investment and increase fiscal revenues. This will help lower borrowing costs and reduce funding needs. These countries must also improve the human capital of their large, young populations, especially as the rest of the world is aging rapidly.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence also gives hope for boosting productivity. It may do so, but the potential for serious disruptions in labor and financial markets is high, and the right infrastructure and regulations are needed.\\n\\nThird, global growth prospects are also harmed by rising geo‑economic fragmentation. Trade linkages are already changing. Some economies could benefit from the reconfiguration of global supply chains, but the net effect may still be a loss of efficiency, making the global economy less, not more resilient, and the broader damage is to global cooperation.\\n\\nA great achievement of the past few years has been the strengthening of monetary, fiscal, and financial policy frameworks, especially for emerging market economies. This has helped make the global financial system more resilient and avoid a permanent resurgence in inflation. Going forward, it is essential to preserve these improvements, and that includes protecting the hard‑won independence of central banks.\\n\\nLastly, the green transition requires major investments. Cutting emissions is compatible with growth, but emissions are still rising, so more needs to be done and done quickly. This will require technology transfers by other advanced economies and China to weather emerging and developing economies, as well as substantial private and public financing.\\n\\nOn these questions, as well as many others, multilateral frameworks and cooperation remain essential for progress. Thank you.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: Thank you, Pierre‑Olivier. Before we open the floor to your questions, some ground rules. If you have a question, please raise your hand and wait until I call you. If I do, please identify yourself and the outlet you represent. We will be taking questions also online and via WebEx. I want to remind everyone that we are here to discuss the World Economic Outlook. If you have questions regarding country programs, negotiations, there is going to be plenty of regional press briefings later on in the week where you can tackle these issues. We are going to start here on the second row.\\n\\nQuestion: David Lawder with Reuters News Service here in Washington. Pierre‑Olivier, can you go a little bit deeper into the scarring that is happening with low‑income developing economies? You said many of these are having a hard time sort of recovering after the various crises that they have been through. How is this being manifested? Which countries are having the worst time of it? Also, if you could comment a bit on the energy price outlook. The United States is looking at potentially new sanctions against Iran after its attack on Israel. That is likely to come in the oil sector. If we do see spikes in prices, what does that mean for inflation globally and the recovery? Thank you.\\n\\nMr. Gourinchas: Thanks, David. Yes, as I mentioned, estimates of scarring, which is the amount of decline in output relative to our pre‑pandemic, say January 2020 estimates, have been reduced for most regions and countries, but they have been increased for low‑income developing countries. Another thing we have noticed over the recent estimates and recent run of projections is also inflation and price pressures have been revised up, so what we are seeing for that region is a combination of still impacts in terms of output and also prices that remain quite strong, price pressures that remain quite strong.\\n\\nWhat is going on here is we are seeing a combination of the effect of relatively high energy and food prices, increased food insecurity in countries in the region that is affecting outcomes. This is a region that is also—had limited—more limited fiscal buffers during the pandemic and the cost‑of‑living crisis to protect its population, and we see the remaining effect of this going on. We are in an environment in which interest rates are rising. There are fiscal pressures and so there is limited space for a lot of these countries to address this among low‑income and developing economies.\\n\\nNow, in terms of potential output for energy price and what it might do to the global economy, this is something that we explored in our report. We looked at a scenario where we would have more geopolitical tensions that would result in elevated oil prices and energy prices and shipping costs. And what we find is that this would lead to higher price pressures in the global economy that would be higher inflation, there would be lower output. And roughly the estimates we have for a sustained increase in oil prices by about 15 percent would be an increase in inflation globally of about 0.7 percent. So there is some effect there. We are not in that scenario right now. Our assessment of what has been happened with the tensions in the Middle East is there has been some increase in oil prices, but it is too early to say whether that would be sustained, and it is not in our baseline, but we certainly looked at the scenario very carefully.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: Let us go there.\\n\\nQuestion: Hello. This is Noor with Bloomberg Asharq. We have a question now. You touched upon the rising inflation again. So interest rates are already really high. How do you see central banks dealing with this, specifically the Fed, especially that now the probability of any decrease in interest rates in June is basically declining?\\n\\nMr. Gourinchas: This is one of the divergences we highlight in our report. We are saying that indeed the drivers of the inflation in countries like the United States are somewhat different than they are in other regions in the world, especially if you look at the Euro Area or the U.K. or Japan. There is evidence, which we document in our report, that tight labor markets, strong demand are playing a role in the U.S. And if that were to be reinforced, then the recent inflation print numbers in the U.S. seem to point in that direction, although we have to take that with a grain of salt. There is a lot of volatility in the month‑to‑month inflation numbers. Then I would probably call for a delayed easing of monetary policy in the U.S.\\n\\nAt the same time, I want to say that we would still expect the U.S. to be in a position where it starts easing sometime in 2024. The progress has been enormous in terms of disinflation and the resilience of the economy. What we are seeing now is maybe a slight adjustment in terms of the baseline.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: OK. We are going to go here in the first row and then we will go back.\\n\\nQuestion: Yes. Thank you very much for the opportunity. So, China’s Q1 GDP number just came in at 5.3 percent, which was just released last night. So, how does that number look to you and given all‑year target, 5 percent, in the setback in the China government, so does that first quarter GDP number give you more confidence that we can reach the—hit the target for the whole year?\\n\\nAlso, in your remarks, you mentioned that China’s domestic demand will remain lackluster for quite some time. So strong measures and reforms just the root cause, so can you elaborate? What do you mean by the strong measures and the reforms? Thank you very much.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: Before we answer the question, we also have a question on WebEx on China, please, the reporter that wants to come in on WebEx. Weier.\\n\\nQuestion: This is question from ETIME Media Group. In the context of the green transition, how should global cooperation be instructed and what role can China play in this collaborative effort? Additionally, at the last WEO release, you noted that globalization is plateauing. Have there been any changes in this trend and what impact might this have on global cooperation to address the climate change? Thank you.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: So, we can go with the GDP numbers and then we can go with the climate one.\\n\\nMr. Gourinchas: Yes, happy to. First, yes, last night, it was released that China’s GDP year‑on‑year for the first quarter was 5.3 percent. This is higher than the estimates. This is certainly higher also than the estimates we had here at the Fund. So the team will be assessing how they are revising their growth projections for the annual numbers, and it might be revised upwards. But I would like to emphasize some of the—some of the structural forces that are driving the Chinese economy right now. And certainly one of the important ones is the weakness in the property sector. And in our forecast for this year, our forecast was unchanged from January at 4.6 percent. There were two balancing forces. One was stronger stimulus that was coming from the Chinese government with measures that were announced as recently last month, in March, but then the continued weakness in the property sector and the two in our assessment were balancing each other out and leading to an unchanged forecast. Now we will have to see whether that is revised.\\n\\nBut the underlying weakness in the property sector is still there, and some of the indicators that we have and that were released even in the last few days do seem to point out that that weakness will persist. So when we are referring to reform measures that would be needed, those would be measures that would directly address some of the root cause in the weakness in the property sector, and that includes dealing with property developers that are struggling right now and recapitalizing or winding them down, then finding ways in which also there might be ways to sustain domestic consumption for China in the medium to long term, and that includes maybe building stronger safety nets.\\n\\nThe broader context here, and that allows me to answer the second question on China, is that with an economy that has potentially still relatively weak domestic demand but is growing, then there would be an increased reliance on the export sector. And that is something that in the context of very tight trade tensions could be complicated. So certainly that would be in the interest of the Chinese economy to develop ways of sustaining domestic demand. Let me turn to Daniel to see if there are any other points on China.\\n\\nMr. Leigh: I would just add that the green transition and the high-tech sectors present a great opportunity for China and policies like evening the playing field between state‑owned and private enterprises are going to help China capitalized on this great potential.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: OK. We are going to the third row. It is the third row. Yes, there.\\n\\nQuestion: Larry Elliott of the Guardian. I just wonder whether you could say a bit more about the tensions in the Middle East. The world economy has been hit by a number of shocks in recent years, including the war in Ukraine. Is there a risk that the conflict between Israel and Iran could be the next [malign] in the global economy? Maybe you could unpack a bit more how you think it would impact on the global economy, not just through oil prices, but through business and consumer confidence.\\n\\nMr. Gourinchas: Yes. Certainly we watch the developments happening in that space, and we try to adjust our scenarios and our analysis based on that, so as I mentioned earlier, the way we approach this is by evaluating different possible trajectories for the global economy. The one that we describe in detail in our report is one where you would have fairly significant disruptions in oil markets that will lead to a 15 percent increase in oil prices and also an increase in shipping costs.\\n\\nSo, of course, one could think about more adverse scenarios than that, but I think that is something that we have not really contemplated just yet. The impact, to unpack a little bit the channels here, you are right, there would be an impact on business confidence. There would be an impact on investment, probably.\\n\\nThe increased inflation that would come from higher energy prices would trigger a response from central banks that would tighten interest rates in order to secure inflation coming back to target, and that would weigh down on activity, and that would do so in the context in which in some countries activity in growth is already fairly weak, and so that might also have a strong effect there.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: OK. First row there.\\n\\nQuestion: Thank you very much. Joel Hills from ITV News. I wanted to pick up, Pierre‑Olivier, on some of the comments you were making about prioritization of rebuilding buffers, consolidation you say is never easy, but it is important that it is early gradual and credible. Sort of within that context, are you comfortable with the British approach of cutting taxes on an assumption, I suppose of future unspecified cuts to public spending?\\n\\nMr. De Haro: There is another question online from Holly Williams, Press Association, that says was it responsible for the U.K. chancellor to cut taxes in the latest budget when inflation is still above target, and it risks putting more pressure on price rises?\\n\\nMr. Gourinchas: What we emphasize in our report is a number of countries need to do—many of the countries in the world that have deployed fiscal buffers during the pandemic and the cost‑of‑living crisis have seen their debt‑to‑GDP increase substantially. Now, some of that has come down a little bit. This is the effect of unexpected inflation, if you want, but if you look at the trajectory, it is starting to grow again in many countries. And so we are calling for rebuilding these buffers, which is absolutely necessary to be able to deal with the kind of shocks that might be larger in magnitude and might be the—there might be more than one and the same time. We seem to be living in this shock‑prone world. Having that fiscal capacity is important. That is true for the U.K., but that is true for many other countries. That is true for many—chiefly this is true for the United States, this is true for many European economies, this is true for many countries around the world. So this is a general assessment that it is very important to do that. We see very clearly that those country that had the fiscal room to protect households and businesses during these two crises were able to do much better and were able to rebound much more quickly. So it is a time now that these crises are behind us, at least both of these crises are behind us, but we could be facing future crises and they could be coming to be prepared.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: We will take a question from WebEx and then go back to the room. Be patient. We will take more questions do not worry.\\n\\nWe have a question from Siram. Please go ahead. Hello. Can you here us?\\n\\nQuestion: You projected a 6.8 percent and 6.5 percent growth rate for India over the last 2 years. Could you please elaborate on your policy recommendations for India? Specifically, could you comment on the employment situation there and other pressures to these growth numbers, such as net financial assets for those and private consumption which has been impacted by food inflation for many? Thank you.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: We have another question, similar question on India from the Economic Times on the press center that says, you have raised India’s growth forecast for 2024. What are the upsides and downside risks to this 6.8 percent number? How will the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East affect growth and inflation forecasts?\\n\\nMr. Gourinchas: Yes, thank you. Indeed, India is one of the strong performers. We had a fairly sharp revision in the Fiscal Year 2023 to 2024, the one that is ending, and that has just ended. Then we have 0.3 percentage point upgrade for Fiscal Year 2024 to 2025. So India is doing quite well. Let me turn to Daniel to answer more specifically.\\n\\nMr. Leigh: [No audio]. Moderation partly reflects the tightening in monetary policy and the tightening in fiscal policy, which is necessary to bring inflation down. We see inflation coming down — is in the target range 4.6 this year, 4.2 next year. There are upside risks to this forecast. They could be further strengthened in private demand.\\n\\nAlso, an upside comes from the potential for reforms that would liberalize foreign investment and really boost exports and boost jobs and labor force participation. So it’s a very strong outlook, and there’s a balanced risk outlook.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: Do we have any questions? We are going to the second row.\\n\\nQuestion: Hi. I am Daniel Avis, AFP. Just a quick question about Russia, if I may. Can you help us just to understand what is behind the very significant increase not only now but over the last few months to the IMF’s forecast for Russia? Thank you.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: And I think we have another question on question on WebEx. Please come in. We cannot hear you.\\n\\nQuestion: Good morning. Anton with TASS Agency of Russia. Thank you so much for doing this. The same question.\\n\\nThe growth rate of the Russian economy is high into 2024, then similar figures on the Group of Seven countries that imposed sanctions against Russia. In this case, can we say that Russia was able to successfully overcome the sanctions restrictions? Thank you so much.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: Yes.\\n\\nMr. Gourinchas: Yes. So we have revised Russia’s GDP growth in 2024 by 0.6 percentage points, to 3.2 percent, so this is a significant upward revision. We are still expecting growth to decline in 2025, from 3.2 percent to 1.8 percent.\\n\\nI will turn to my colleague Petya Koeva Brooks to provide additional details.\\n\\nMs. Koeva Brooks: Thank you. So there are several factors behind the resilience of the Russian economy and the upgrades that we have made. I would mention four factors.\\n\\nFirst, oil export volumes have held steady. The second part is that we have seen a lot of strength in corporate investment, including by state‑owned enterprises. The third is that we have also seen a lot of robustness in private consumption that has underpinned growth. And last, but not least, we have also had the impact from government spending; though there, we have seen much larger increases in security‑related spending than overall spending.\\n\\nNow to put this in context, though, if we look into the medium term, there, we still have growth rates that are significantly below what they were prior to the war. Now we have growth rates in the order of one and a quarter, as opposed to 1.7, which we had previously, which is another way of saying that the Russian economy is still expected to face these headwinds as a result of the—again, the impact of the war and the associated sanctions. Thanks.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: We are going to go to the fourth row. Yep.\\n\\nQuestion: Thank you. Susan Lynch from Politico. I have a question about the growth figures for Europe, the German economy, in particular, only going growing by 0.2 percent. What’s your analysis of that? And how concerned are you about the eurozone economy, in particular, particularly in comparison to the U.S.?\\n\\nMr. Gourinchas: So on the the euro economy, we have a region that has been feeling the full brunt of the energy crisis of the last 2022 and part of 2023 and is gradually emerging from that in the context of tight monetary policy. And so what we are seeing is a pickup in activity from 2023 to 2024. So growth in Germany, for instance, is very modest, 0.2 percent, but it’s higher than the negative growth in 2023. And the same is true at the level of the euro area, where we expect growth to grow from 0.4 percent in ‘23 to 0.8 percent in ‘24. And then as we go into 2025, we expect that monetary policy will start easing. So financial conditions will become easier, and also that the cost of living receding the purchasing power of households and workers will increase as real wages catch up. And that will also sustain demand. But we start from a position of relatively weak consumer sentiment, still tight monetary policy, and that’s still weighing down on growth in this year. Let me turn to Petya for additional comments on Germany and Europe.\\n\\nMs. Koeva Brooks: I don’t have much to add on Germany. For the euro area, some of the same factors are playing a role, although we do have quite a lot of heterogeneity within the euro area. So we do have upward revisions in other countries—for instance, Spain, Portugal, Belgium—that partially offset the downward revisions in Germany and France.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: We go to the first row here, and then we will move to this side.\\n\\nQuestion: Thank you. Two questions on Argentina. You foresee a sharp decline in inflation and a rebound of GDP. I was hoping, if you could elaborate, if you see the disinflation process on solid footing, first.\\n\\nSecond, there’s a debate among economies, whether the recovery is going to be in L, V, or U shape. I was hoping you could pick a letter and tell us how and when the recovery, you see it happening. Thanks.\\n\\nMr. Gourinchas: So, on Argentina, I mean, the authorities are implementing a very ambitious stabilization plan to restore macroeconomic stability. And as you know, the plan is centered on a strong fiscal anchor that eliminates, in particular, any central bank financing of the government, which was one of the factors that was leading to very elevated inflation numbers under—in previous years. And so that is already showing its effects. We see this sharp decline in month‑on‑month inflation.\\n\\nSo the progress so far has been really impressive. The authorities have been able to record a fiscal surplus for the first time in over a decade. But, of course, this is going to take some time, and that’s going to require steadfast policy implementation. Much more needs to be done, and much more needs to be done on the broader scale. So I think this is—we are watching this situation closely. Our teams here at the Fund are in close contact with the authorities. But the progress, again, has been quite sharp. Now, whether that’s going to be a V, U, or L, let’s agree that we’d much prefer V over U over L.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: And with the alphabet, we are going to move toward this side of the room, the lady that —thank you.\\n\\nQuestion: Hello. Ana Rodriguez. El Tiempo, Colombian Newspaper. In general, what the growth perspective for Latin America, not only for Argentina? And across the world, what is the—how do you see the oil markets in that region, please? Thank you.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: Before we answer, there are two specific questions about the outlook on Mexico and Brazil. So if we could elaborate, too, that would be great.\\n\\nMr. Gourinchas: So let me just give a few numbers and then turn it over to Petya.\\n\\nThe Latin American and Caribbean region, we see growth that has been—is going to slow down a little bit, from 2.7 percent to 2.5 percent. The numbers I give you here are excluding Argentina and Venezuela, which have fairly specific environments. And that is revised up in 2024 by 0.2 percentage points. So there is a lot of resilience in the region, as well; although, of course, a number of countries in the region have tight monetary policy—in fact, tight monetary policy that started ahead of what advanced economies did. And that is weighing down on growth and is expected to go away as we have some easing of monetary conditions. Petya.\\n\\nMs. Koeva Brooks: Maybe a few words on Mexico and Brazil. Starting with Brazil, we are expecting growth to come down from 2.9 in ‘23 to 2.2 this year, and then to stay about the same at about the same rate, 2.1, in 2025.\\n\\nNow, last year, we saw a lot of strength due to record agricultural production. And this time around, we see moderation in that, as well as the—\\n\\nWe also have an upgrade in our forecast for this year as a result of the fiscal support, which is expected to be seen in the country.\\n\\nNow, when it comes to Mexico, we are expecting growth to come down to 2.4 this year, from 3.2 last year, and then going onto 2025 to be a 1.4. We have seen a strong recovery in the second half of 2023 due to a lot of internal demand, especially investment. And, of course, the strength of the U.S. economy and the close links of Mexico with that have also played a role. I will stop here. Thanks.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: OK. We have 10 minutes. I am going to come back here. I know that you’ve been waiting very patiently. Let’s go to that side of the room, Bloomberg, and then we will end up here. I hope that we still have two, three questions left. So don’t worry.\\n\\nQuestion: Thank you, Pierre‑Olivier. Eric Martin with Bloomberg News.\\n\\nI wanted to ask you about your commentary on the U.S. fiscal situation and the fiscal balance. In the report, it mentions larger‑than‑expected government spending, including what’s estimated — or comparison, excuse me, with prior WEO forecasts, 2 percent of GDP in the U.S. Can you talk a little bit about the conversations between the IMF and the U.S. in terms of what the U.S. should be pursuing in terms of fiscal policy and given the size of the U.S. economy—about a quarter of the world economy—how concerning this is for overheating around the world?\\n\\nMr. Gourinchas: Yes. So there is, of course, the cyclical part, and there’s a more structural part. So let me start with the cyclical part. Here, what I would want to emphasize is the U.S. is expected to turn toward fiscal consolidation in 2024. In our projections, there is a 1.9 percent increase in the structural fiscal balance of the U.S. for 2024. And that is one of the reasons, among others, why we are expecting also growth to slow down in this year compared to last year and after that. So there is some movement in the right direction, if you want.\\n\\nBut as for many other countries, we are concerned that this is, A, not enough and, B, more importantly, not necessarily sustained over a sufficient period of time, that it would bring back debt‑to‑GDP levels into a more comfortable zone.\\n\\nAnd the background here is that, even if we have an easing of monetary policy that is expected—our baseline is still that the Fed is going to cut policy rates sometime later this year—the funding costs for government debt may not be decreasing as much because of what is called the term premium, the risk premium on government debt has increased in recent times and may remain high in the context that debt levels are elevated and there are risks around that. So we are concerned that more of that medium‑term implication of the fiscal trajectory for the U.S. Daniel, anything to add?\\n\\nMr. De Haro: Third row there. Nope. I will take both questions. You are first.\\n\\nQuestion: My name is Ivan. I work for AFP and the Africa Report. I have one question. This is going to be a very interesting year for Africa, especially about close to 19 countries are going for general elections. I want to know your projections, considering the fact that this usually comes with a lot of political violence in some areas, as well as sluggish growth that has affected the sub‑Saharan region. I want to know more about the recommendations you have for these African countries that are going for elections, especially in this period, and what you expect. Thank you.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: Yeah. Let’s go first with this question and then we can—\\n\\nMr. Gourinchas: I mean, 2024 is the biggest election year on record, and so the question of elections is important for many parts of the world, including Africa. And that is a concern especially in relation to what we just discussed, which is the fiscal trajectories that there is a risk there that there could be some fiscal slippage.\\n\\nFor the sub‑Saharan Africa region, our growth number for 2024 is 3.8 percent. This is actually unchanged from our January projection, and it’s up from 3.4 percent in 2023. So there is a rebound in growth and activity, as the supply side improves and maybe as the negative effects of past weather shocks subside.\\n\\nDaniel, anything to add?\\n\\nMr. Leigh: After four years of quite—a lot of turmoil, this is the year where we really see a turnaround in investor appetite for Africa. We have had Côte d’Ivoire issuing the Eurobond, Benin, Kenya spreads easing. So this is going to ease some of the pressure on these economies. Also, as inflation starts to come down, inflation is coming down as those past shocks fade and also thanks to the tight policies that have been implemented. Of course, there’s a lot of risks around this scenario in the context of elections. There could be more spending in the short term that could provide a boost, but there are serious potential disruptions later on, if there’s an easing, as in other parts of the world, this is our assessment.\\n\\nAlso, there’s the upside risk from further acceleration of reforms to help people get jobs and attract more foreign investment.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: Allow me to remind you that there’s going to be regional press briefings going on later this week so we can continue tackling some of these issues. Go ahead and then we will have time for only one question, and we will have to end.\\n\\nQuestion: OK. Thank you very much. My name is Hope Moses from Business Day Nigeria. You raised Nigeria’s growth from 2.9 percent to 3.3 percent, so what are the drivers of this growth, considering the fact that inflation is rising every day, and then the impact of fuel subsidies and other factors. Thank you.\\n\\nMr. Gourinchas: Thank you. I will ask Daniel.\\n\\nMr. Leigh: Yes. Growth in Nigeria, steady but actually rising this year, from 2.9 percent last year to 3.3 percent this year. We have seen an expansion from the recovery in the oil sector, with a better security situation and also improved agriculture, benefiting from the better weather conditions and the introduction of dry season farming. So there’s a broad‑based increase also in the financial sector, in the IT sector. Inflation, yes, it has increased. Part of this reflects the reforms, the exchange rate and its pass‑through into other goods from imports to other goods. So this explains also why we revised up our inflation projection for this year to 26 percent. But with the tight monetary policies and that interest rate increase, significant interest rate increases during February and March, we think—we see inflation declining to 23 percent next year and then 18 percent in 2026. So in the right direction, definitely.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: Last question is going to be the gentleman there. And I am sorry. There’s going to be more opportunities to ask more questions. There are regional press briefings happening later this week where you can tackle all the country‑specific questions.\\n\\nQuestion: Hi. I am from Geo TV Pakistan. We all know climate change is a big problem. So how has the climate change impacted the growth and inflation in the last few years? Because in 2022, floods in Pakistan caused an estimated economic loss of around $30 billion. This is an estimate by the World Bank. And I also would like to know, what is the IMF doing to help these countries that are being damaged by the climate change?\\n\\nMr. Gourinchas: So we are seeing, in fact, increased weather shocks related to the climate transition, and that is impacting sometimes countries at a macroeconomic level. And the example of Pakistan I think is a relevant one here. But there are other countries that are, of course, in that situation. And often, what we have is that countries that are among the low‑income countries might be more vulnerable to these extreme weather events. So it’s a conjunction of having relatively little in terms of fiscal buffers or ability or infrastructure and the capacity to deal with these events and, therefore, they have a much larger impact on people’s well‑being and livelihoods. So that’s something that is factored into our rounds of projections. We do take into account the broad array of risks that countries are facing.\\n\\nThe second part of your question, what the Fund can do. I mean, the Fund, along with other organizations, is of course—international organizations, is very focused on climate issues. We have an instrument, the Resilience and Sustainability Trust, that is designed to help countries build that resilience going forward and help them be able to weather these types of shocks. We are also involved in providing technical assistance in helping countries both adapt and put in place mitigation strategies for climate change. Thanks.\\n\\nMr. De Haro: OK. So we are going to have to wrap it here but on behalf of Pierre‑Olivier, Petya, and Daniel, the Research Department, Communications Department, I want to thank you all. A couple of reminders, the next press briefing is the Global Financial Stability Report in this same room. Tomorrow, pay attention to the Fiscal Monitor and as I said, later this week, regional press briefings. You can tackle those country‑specific questions. And don’t forget also to come to the Managing Director’s press briefing. Thank you very much.

However, the orders still remain approximately 4.4% below the levels observed in the same period last year. Particularly, the manufacturing of ‘other transport vehicles’ experienced a 34% decline in new orders compared to the previous month after an exceptionally high surge in demand in October. Similar patterns were observed in the chemical and electrical industries, both facing decreases in orders, albeit not to the extent seen in the other transport vehicle manufacturing sector.\\n\\nNevertheless, a glance at the still-high order backlogs reveals that many companies still maintain a respectable safety cushion. While the order backlog dwindled further in October compared to the previous month (-0.6%), industry-wide order books still cover an average of 6.9 months. The only cause for increased concern lies in the automotive industry, where order backlogs are depleting much faster than in other sectors (-2.9%).\\n\\nAmid the challenging economic conditions, bankruptcy filings are once again gaining momentum. In 2023, the number of corporate bankruptcies increased by 23.5% to 18,100 cases. On one hand, this suggests a return to normalcy as the figures now align with pre-pandemic levels, following the temporary suspension of bankruptcy reporting requirements during the pandemic. On the other hand, it is anticipated that the bankruptcy figures will continue to rise significantly in 2024.', 'Strategy and business building for the data-driven economy:\\n\\nThe best of the best: the portal for top lists & rankings:\\n\\nGet quick analyses with our professional research service\\n\\nDirectly accessible data for 170 industries from 150+ countries and over 1 Mio. facts.\\n\\nDetailed information for 39,000+ online stores and marketplaces\\n\\nBusiness information on 100m+ public and private companies\\n\\nInsights on consumer attitudes and behavior worldwide\\n\\nMarket forecast and expert KPIs for 1000+ markets in 190+ countries & territories\\n\\nAll key figures about countries and regions\\n\\nDetailed information about political and social topics\\n\\nConsumer and brand insights and preferences in various industries\\n\\nKey figures and rankings about companies and products\\n\\nIndustry and market insights and forecasts\\n\\nOverview and forecasts on trending topics\\n\\nNumber of apps available in leading app stores Q3 2022\\n\\nQuarterly smartphone market share worldwide by vendor 2009-2023\\n\\nFacebook: quarterly number of MAU (monthly active users) worldwide 2008-2023\\n\\nPlease create an employee account to be able to mark statistics as favorites.

Private consumption suffered from a loss in purchasing power. High building and borrowing costs on top of labour shortages and elevated energy prices depressed investment in construction and energy-intensive sectors.\\n\\nSentiment indicators continue to be weak, with some indicators in January having reached their lowest levels since the COVID-19 crisis, pointing to subdued economic growth in the first half of 2024. Investment growth is projected to remain low relative to pre-pandemic values, weighed down by downbeat investor sentiment entering the year. Labour shortages continue to be a bottleneck to activity. A trade-led recovery is also unlikely, as exports and imports are set to grow at broadly the same pace in both forecast years. Tighter fiscal policy conditions are also expected to have a dampening impact on short-term growth prospects. On the positive side, market financing conditions have eased moderately and further easing is expected through the bank lending channel. In addition, real incomes are expected to benefit from a robust labour market and rising real wages, which are set to support private consumption over the forecast horizon.\\n\\nOverall, real GDP is forecast to increase by 0.3% in 2024 and 1.2% in 2025. For 2024, this implies a downward revision from 0.8% projected in the Autumn Forecast, while the forecast for 2025 remains unchanged.\\n\\nHICP inflation decelerated from its peak of 11.6% in October 2022 to 6.0% in 2023 as a whole and to 3.1% in January 2024. This reduction is mainly driven by the decline in wholesale energy prices and the introduction of energy support measures, which were discontinued in November 2023. HICP inflation is projected to reach 2.8% in 2024 and 2.4% in 2025. This is broadly in line with the Autumn Forecast. Inflation in both years is forecast to be driven mainly by the services sector, where wage growth is temporarily keeping inflation elevated as expected in the Autumn Forecast 2023. By contrast, energy price growth is set to contribute only slightly to inflation going forward.', \"Transcript of European Department April 2024 Press Briefing\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\\n\\nEUR (EUROPEAN DEPARTMENT) PRESS BRIEFING:\\n\\nECONOMIC OUTLOOK IN EUROPE\\n\\n(182946)\\n\\nWashington, D.C.\\n\\nFriday, April 19, 2024\\n\\nPARTICIPANTS:\\n\\nALFRED KAMMER\\n\\nDirector, European Department\\n\\nInternational Monetary Fund\\n\\nHELGE BERGER\\n\\nDeputy Director, European Department\\n\\nInternational Monetary Fund\\n\\nOYA CELASUN\\n\\nDeputy Director, European Department\\n\\nInternational Monetary Fund\\n\\nCAMILA PEREZ\\n\\nSenior Communications Officer\\n\\nInternational Monetary Fund\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nP R O C E E D I N G S\\n\\n(10:00 a.m.)\\n\\nPÉREZ: Hello everyone. Thank you for joining today's press conference on the release of the European Economic Outlook. My name is Camila Pérez. I am a Communications Officer with the IMF. Here we are with Alfred Kammer. Alfred is the Director of the European Department. We're also here with Oya Celasun and Helge Berger, both Deputy Directors at the European Department of the IMF. Before we start, a reminder that the report on the European Outlook is available on imf.org. We will get started with Alfred's opening remarks and then we'll take your questions. Alfred? KAMMER: Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon to everybody in Europe. I had some prepared opening remarks, such as try to summarize that. First, not to forget we went through two historic crises with the pandemic and the energy security issue caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Policymakers did a remarkable job to end up where we are, but the population clearly is still in pain. What we are now forecasting is a soft landing, but that is not guaranteed. What we saw is a rapid disinflation over the last year and we are now forecasting a recovery in 2024, which gains speed in 2025. I said it's not granted because a lot of things need to go right. One of them is the labor market. It needs to just be right to deliver the robustness and the wage growth in order to generate real income increases, purchasing power for the population to support the consumption-driven recovery this year. If it's too much, we're getting too much inflation, and that would also intervene again on the monetary policy side.\\n\\nNext year, we are expecting an investment driven recovery. We are expecting monetary policy to start on the policy rate side, ECB to undertake rate cuts starting from June on, 26 quarterly, 25 percentage points rate cuts, to end up in neutral in September 2025. For our Eastern European, Central and Southeastern European countries, we also see rate cuts ahead, but it will be more gradually in terms of what we are seeing in achieving the inflation target. In the Euro area, we expect the inflation target to be reached in the first half and in CESEE countries, as we call them, only in 2026.\\n\\nFiscal policy has been supporting this inflation effort over the last year through consolidation, mostly by cutting out energy packages, cost of living packages. We now need to shift to a medium-term focus. That means to ensure debt sustainability, build up fiscal buffers for future shocks, but also be ready to expand spending pressures, which we are estimating to reach 5.5 percent for advanced European economies annually by 2050 and 8.5 percent of GDP for CESEE -- for emerging European countries. Those are large numbers. Therefore, action needs to be taken on the fiscal side to accommodate these spending needs. They're coming from climate, defense, pensions, higher interest rates.\\n\\nWhen we are now looking at the medium-term growth trajectory, that remains rather modest. We looked at where Europe is currently, with regard to the global frontier on output and welfare. When you're looking at the global frontier in terms of GDP per capita, in purchasing power terms, the leader is the U.S. Europe is one third lower than the U.S. That has not always been the case. And when we are looking at the explanatory factors, where this is coming from, this comes mainly from lower productivity in Europe versus the U.S. That means Europe needs to focus on productivity in order to close this gap to the U.S. And productivity growth projected will face a lot of headwinds and is not able to close this gap in the forecast horizon. Therefore, additional actions are required.\\n\\nAnd our recommendation to Europe is to focus on building out and deepening the single market. Single market was a growth booster in the 90s. There is much to do in terms of further integration. It is not just capital markets and banking union, it is border infrastructure, where there's still frictions, labor mobility, portability of education certificates, a whole host of issues which can be done, in addition to what we are recommending on the domestic and national sites, on structural reforms.\\n\\nWhen we did a study and the bottom line was if we reduce those barriers in the single market by 10 percentage points, the boost to GDP will be 7 percent in terms of level. That is a large number. So this needs to be done and it needs to be done with urgency. Deepening of the single market will also be a response to the more difficult geoeconomic environment because you are going to build resilience in this single market by deepening it and you're making the economy more robust. And we had a big geoeconomic shock with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the energy security issues arising in Europe. Robustness, resilience is a necessary ingredient in going forward.\\n\\nWhat not to do? Trade protectionism by all, subsidy wars by all, would lower global welfare. The global machine in producing prosperity over the last decades was driven by trade, the free flow of goods, services, and capital. If we stop that engine, it will be a disaster for the global populations. So that is not the right way to go. For Europe, in particular, if there are subsidies which are being suggested, they should be limited to market failures. They should be temporary, targeted, and consistent. And importantly, they need to be at the EU level and not at the national level, because that would be costly in terms of allocative efficiency.\\n\\nSo, in a nutshell, this is our main policy advice for Europe. Lots to do. Europe has changed dramatically over the last decade. So Europe can do it, but it requires a lot of political will in order to get there. Thank you.\\n\\nPÉREZ: Thanks, Alfred. We will get started with questions in the room. The gentleman in the third row, please.\\n\\nQUESTIONER: Hi, thank you for doing this. I just wanted a clarification and then a question. The clarification is, if I get it well, you said that lowering the internal barriers in the single market by about 10 percent will make the GDP grow by 7 percent. And the question is, in the outlook you mentioned that uncoordinated policy response to trade fragmentation could weaken the European single market. That there are already subsidy measures imposed by EU countries that other EU members increased by over 50 percent by the onset of the crisis. Could you elaborate this point, please?\\n\\nKAMMER: On the first question, to reconfirm, a ten percentage point cut in internal barriers will increase the level of GDP by 7 percent. This is quite a number. And one of the issues in the European market is that you cannot operate to scale and that's very different from the market in the U.S. You need to basically have approaches to 27 individual markets, including on bankruptcy, et cetera. So, that will create lots of improvements in productivity if these things are harmonized or barriers are being taken out.\\n\\nOur concern is with regard to subsidies, which have grown over the last few years in the EU at the national level, as they were allowed under the pandemic response function. What you're seeing is that the larger and the richer European countries can undertake those subsidies, but overall, they are going to hurt Europe. They are not only costly, but they are also affecting allocative efficiency because capital will go to these companies, capital will go to these sectors, and that leads to a suboptimal outcome in terms of output. Therefore, our recommendation - eliminate barriers in the internal market. Don't focus on subsidies. And if subsidies, they should be at the EU level in order not to fray the single market.\\n\\nPÉREZ: We're going to stay in the room. I see some of you are online. We'll get to you. We're going to take a few more questions here. Third row here, please.\\n\\nQUESTIONER: Larry Elliot of the Guardian, question about the U.K. The U.K. government has cut taxes twice in the last six months and there's reports that it wants to cut taxes again before the election. In the IMF's view, will these tax cuts have to be paid for by tax increases or spending cuts after the election?\\n\\nPÉREZ: Thanks, Larry. We're going to see if there any other questions on the U.K.? The lady here on the second row, please.\\n\\nQUESTIONER: Szu Chan from the Telegraph. Our Prime Minister today has announced proposals to try to stem a rise in the number of people claiming sickness benefits. Do you think the U.K. has a problem with economic inactivity and what should be done to help these people, particularly those suffering from mental health conditions?\\n\\nPÉREZ: One more question here. The gentleman in the third row, please.\\n\\nQUESTIONER: Alex Brummer from the Daily Mail. This is again in the tax area. The Managing Director, in her address earlier in the week or in her comments earlier in the week, referred to measures to increase productivity. And I noticed that there was no reference at all to tax reductions in her comments. And I just wondered if you felt there is a role for tax reductions in improving productivity and outcomes and growth. And secondly, just going back to your comments about fragmentation subsidies, I just was wondering whether you felt it was possible for Europe and the U.K., if we include ourselves in the continent, which we are to, to resist the pressures which are coming from the United States, where all kinds of subsidies are being applied, chip production, climate change subsidies, a whole series of measures which seem to be anti-competitive, including new steel tariffs?\\n\\nPÉREZ: On the U.K. Helge, do you want to talk to it? BERGER: Yeah, why don't I start with U.K. So, on the disability issue -- so let me step back a moment and say just how important labor supply has been for growth in the U.K. If you look back at the last 10 years, actually most of the growth momentum has come from population growth or, you know, an expanding labor force, including from immigration. And so in that context, if you have an increase in inactivity rates, there's a concern also for growth. And so, that's the way we look at this. There are two elements to this. One is the number of people that could be working. The other element is productivity. If people are ill but have to work, then they may be less productive than otherwise.\\n\\nSo I think it is an area that deserves the attention of policymakers. So we're happy that this is a focus point. In terms of what needs to be done, we are going to look at this more closely during the Article IV, which you may know is coming to the U.K in May. Certainly, one area to think about is the quality of healthcare that is being provided to people. Another element may have to do with the way disability is supported. We are taking note of these proposals and we look more into this going forward. So, thanks for this question.\\n\\nI would have been disappointed if nobody had asked about tax cuts in the U.K. As you know, we're following this closely. The tax proposals that may come in the future, including in the fall budget, are a little bit out there for us. So we would rather not speculate on their particular form or shape, but we will of course consider them and discuss them as we get closer. The broader point is that there is an effort underway in the U.K. to provide fiscal consolidation, which we think is appropriate given the trajectory of public debt. But there's also significant pressure in the medium-term on the budget, coming both from the expenses, side spending on health services, for example. We already discussed this a little bit. There's a need for infrastructure investment and so on. And so with all these things on the table, there's a need to look for a fiscal space. And I think we're going to have to look both at revenue measures and expenditure measures going forward. Now, that third question, I sense was more of a larger perspective.\\n\\nKAMMER: Yeah, maybe second part first. With regard to the subsidy raise, we document in the report that tit for tat subsidies and retaliation is welfare-reducing for both. So we are strongly appealing to all stakeholders in the multilateral rules based system to maintain it because it has served us well. There will always be frictions. They should be resolved through cooperative solutions and through WTO. So, I think that's important in order to continue getting the benefits from this globalized economy that we have.\\n\\nWhen it comes to taxes, in the report, we have a variety of suggestions actually to make the tax system more efficient and more effective. Moving away from labor taxes, which are a disincentive to work. Moving more to wealth taxes and property taxes, where there is a lot of room in many countries, in order to generate more revenue. Overall, what we see for Europe is, first, Europe has decided about a welfare state model that needs to be financed, and for that you need to have a solid tax base. Second, we see further spending pressures coming up, and as I said for advanced European economies, by 2050, this will be annually 5.5 percent of GDP. For that, again, you need to, in some of the countries, increase taxes. Some other countries will be able to do some spending reprioritization.\\n\\nBut overall, it will be a mix of both. And when you're looking at the efficiency of tax system, much can be done in order to generate more revenue, including by eliminating loopholes, tax exemptions, et cetera. So it doesn't need to be always an increase in tax rates. That's probably a suggestion for Eastern European and Central European countries. But for Western European countries, much rely in increasing demand effectiveness of the taxes.\\n\\nPÉREZ: I think we can go online to WebEx. Please go ahead.\\n\\nQUESTIONER: Thank you for doing this. And my question: President of Russia Vladimir Putin has directed the government to ensure that Russia ascends into the top four largest economies globally by GDP at purchasing power parity before 2030. Does the IMF expect Russia to achieve this goal? Thank you.\\n\\nPÉREZ: Thank you. Do we have any other questions on Russia forecast now? KAMMER: So what we have been forecasting for Russia is actually growth this year, and we also have seen quite strong growth last year, that was explained by economic activity has remained strong because oil export volumes remained while prices were high. We saw a rebound in consumptions, labor markets are strong, and real wages have been increasing. A large amount of that increase in GDP was actually explained by a boom in investment that reflected state-owned enterprises, including investments in security and defense related issues. But also what we saw is an increase in investment for import substitution. And finally, there is not much support from the fiscal side, but it was there as well. Most of the fiscal support was lent to security and defense. So that explains also the upgrade of our numbers for 2023 for Russia and the growth outlook for this year.\\n\\nThis is a short-term projection we have in place. When we are looking at the longer-term, we are seeing something continuing which started to happen for Russia in 2014. And that was a fallback in potential growth, and that has hurt and is continuing to hurt Russia's convergence to European GDP levels. We expect that technological diffusion will be more of an issue in the future, but there's lots of uncertainty on how that is developing. But we are not seeing a pickup in potential growth rather than a decline in potential growth. So when we are looking at our outlook, actually in per capita GDP terms, we see Russia in terms of ranking falling back rather than advancing.\\n\\nPÉREZ: We're going to go back to the room. Let's take the lady on the second floor, please.\\n\\nQUESTIONER: My question is on Spain. The IMF has said that the Spanish economy is in good shape, but also that the economic growth could be affected by aging population. Brussels has just said that Spain is expected to have the biggest increase in spending on pensions. In order not to lose its economic boost. what would you recommend to tackle that, and to achieve that unemployment goes below 10 percent?\\n\\nKAMMER: Indeed, the Spanish economy is in good shape and it weathered the crisis very well, including also with a robust labor market. And like all of the other economies, Spain -- all of the other economies in Europe, I should say, the major headwind is coming in future from a reduction -- sorry, from aging and a potential reduction in the workforce through demographics. And that is an issue and a big headwind for Europe to take care of, not just for Spain.\\n\\nWhen we're looking at Spain, Spain did undertake a number of labor reforms which actually contributed to the success on the labor market. Going forward, when we are looking at particular reforms, we need to be careful in order not to take back these successes. For instance, in the discussion in reducing the work week, that is going to be important. Overall, like in all countries, labor force participation is going to be key in order to address the workforce force depletion through aging, and immigration is another tool which is available to countries. And on pension reforms, et cetera, again, an issue important for all of Europe that we need to have sound fiscal policies in place. That means also parametric reforms on the pension side in order to make pensions sustainable in the future.\\n\\nPÉREZ: We're going to go with the lady on the third row, please\\n\\nQUESTIONER: I just have two questions. Just going back to your initial comments about your warning about use of subsidies, what do you say to European policymakers, given the very disappointing growth figures we saw even this week, particularly in the largest economy, Germany, when countries like the United States are plowing money into their own economies, like the Inflation Reduction Act? I mean, how realistic is it to ask, you know, to expect Europe to improve when it's in -- when it is in this kind of tit for tat race? And secondly, are you concerned about possible divergence when it comes to the ECB and the, in the U.S., the Fed changing interest rates over the next few months, and what kind of impact that might have?\\n\\nKAMMER: To your -- to your first question, we document in the report that tit for tat on trade or tit for tat on subsidies is going to be welfare detracting and that's not the way to go. It may seem at the moment as the right policy response. It isn't. And when we are looking at Europe in particular, it's not just current growth rates and projected growth in productivity. There's a large gap between the U.S. and Europe with regard to per capita GDP in purchasing power terms. That needs to be fixed and that will not be fixed through any of such measures. And for that, Europe needs to undertake structural reforms. And for that we are suggesting that these reforms will be undertaken. And one big leverage Europe has, and one big potential which is at its fingertips is deepening and further integration into the single market. That's where you get a lot of bang for the buck in terms of reforms.\\n\\nOn your second question, when you're looking at ECB monetary policy, what we are expecting is a gradual reduction in the policy rates. But clearly ECB needs to be ready to be tighter or potentially be looser than the path we have been suggesting, simply because there are lots of uncertainties still in the system. We are still looking carefully at service inflation, which has been stuck in the euro area at 4 percent for the last five months. That's going to be more persistent because nominal wages are going to feed into the service sector and demand is stronger still for services than it is for good. So that's one risk which is there. We have another upside risks through geo economic and political developments, including on the oil markets. That could be an upside risk. We have a downside risk if growth is weaker. And you were pointing to another upside risk on the inflation side for Europe, and that is if the tightening path for the US is going to diverge from the baseline we have in there. We did some simulations of what the impact on euro area inflation would be. The impact is relatively small if you're thinking about a sustained divergence in the policy rate, but clearly there will be an impact. What we are seeing is there's lots of uncertainty on the inflation going forward. So our advice to the ECB is that ECB needs to remain data dependent. It needs to take meeting by meeting decisions and be ready to adjust that policy cost which we have been plotted out in our REO.\\n\\nPÉREZ: We're going to go to that side of the room. The lady in red on the fourth row, please.\\n\\nQUESTIONER: Thank you. In the report you issued today, you are giving us details on the Italy growth for 2026 and there is a huge revision downwards, 0.9 percent to 0.2 percent. Can you explain this? And also, if I can ask a second question. The IMF has always been in favor of infrastructure projects as a means to boost growth. I wonder if you have an idea and a comment to make on the project that the Italian government is planning, the bridge that it's planning to be built connecting Sicily to mainland Italy.\\n\\nPÉREZ: I am getting two more questions online on Italy. I'm going to read them out loud. The IMF forecast Italy to grow at a modest pace of 0.7 percent this year and the next. At the same time you asked for front loaded fiscal consolidation. Where in particular do you think Italy should find the efficiencies in terms of cost cutting to achieve that target. And do you think the 1.2 percent growth forecast by the government for 2025 is credible or too ambitious? One last question. Can you give us a bit more details about what type of credible adjustment on the debt trajectory the IMF expects from Italy? BERGER: Thank you for these. Let's start with the questions on the outlook. Just to bring everybody on the same page. So what we're expecting, based on the newest baseline forecast, is growth that was about 0.9 last year, to reduce to 0.7 this year and 0.7 next. And then growth declines, as you pointed out in 2026, to around a quarter of a percent. Now behind this is an economy that is growing broadly in line with potential outputs. Potential output is between 0.7, 0.8. So that's in the background. And the economy is there because we had a very strong recovery out of the double crisis in Europe. We had COVID and the energy crisis affecting Italy, like all the other economies in the region. So this is a solid performance coming out of the crisis. Now, what you see moving these growth rates around potential has to do with large investment programs. So it's fiscal policy that plays a large role. The slowdown this year and next compared to last year is mostly the fact that the super bonus program -- you will be familiar, for everybody else, this is a tax credit for remodeling of houses -- is slowly withdrawing. So that has a downward effect on growth.\\n\\nAt the same time, the Italian plans for the National Recovery and Resiliency Plan, that is the way European money, both in grants and loan form, is being spent, is only slowly picking up. So that explains the slight revision down this year and next, and then in ‘26, what you have is the super bonus coming to an end, while the NRP money is there, but not as forceful. And then you will see some more of this in 2027 when NRP is also withdrawing. So I think the main upshot here is that there is policy dues, fluctuations around growth. And I guess the good news around this is that it also suggests that policy can make a difference for growth. So it's not cast in stone that we will see growth in 2026 fall, as we are currently projecting under current policies.\\n\\nAnd there are two things that could help, among others. One is you can make sure that domestic structural reforms that are in track, there are ongoing efforts in the justice reform, tax administration, other areas. So an intensification of this reform momentum would certainly help. And then the country obviously can think about a domestic succession program to the reforms that are currently tied to European support. So there's a lot work to be done in terms of infrastructure, education reform. And so, these kinds of efforts will ultimately make a difference if they're taken forward with greater momentum. So that's roughly where we are on growth. Now, you mentioned infrastructure projects. So we usually, the Fund, we look at this at the very aggregate level. So it's investment overall that we're interested in, including infrastructure. So we're not really good at looking at individual projects. But it's clear that for each individual project that is part of a public infrastructure initiative in any country, you want to look at the costs and the benefits. You want only to do what is really beneficial on net. You want to make sure that the project is handled with good governance so there's little public money wasted. So these kind of principles would apply to Italy and any other country. I think that's Italian growth. That's it. Well, we did Italian growth.\\n\\nPÉREZ: I think we're going to go to the first row here. The gentleman with the jacket.\\n\\nQUESTIONER: I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about how much the inflation path between the US and the EU has already diverged, given the latest very strong data we've seen in the US, is it your expectation that probably the ECB is going to have to go first in terms of easing policy rates? And then secondly on trade. What a lot of countries are looking at right now is protecting themselves against what they see as China's excess capacity in key industries like electric vehicles and solar. The US is looking at some things. The European Union has an investigation going on and the EV sector into Chinese subsidies. So what do you expect on that front? Is there a danger here that we're sort of headed into a new trade war that could hurt growth? Thanks.\\n\\nKAMMER: On your first question, with regard to U.S. versus Europe and more broadly, but also euro area, there were always two very different inflation stories. When you're looking at the US, you had much more of a demand driven element in the inflation. And when you're looking at Europe and that spans the euro area and all European countries, including the UK, you had much more of an impact with regard to the energy price shock coming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. So two different inflation stories to begin with, and when we are looking at the disinflation taking place in Europe and in the euro area in particular, the number one disinflationary force last year was the rapid decline of the contribution of energy prices to inflation, the unwinding of supply change blockages, and last but not least, the monetary policy impact. That's what we are seeing right now. And when you're looking at the U.S., that demand element which was there, supported by the fiscal stance, is much stronger than whatever we saw in Europe.\\n\\nTherefore, for us, it was always, it seemed to look the same, but the drivers were different. And because of the drivers being different, that probably means a different disinflation effort and likely also a different, potentially a monetary policy stance. So what we are expecting right now is there's still some uncertainty on the European side, especially on the part of the disinflation coming from the services side. So it could be more persistent. But if this works out as expected, then we are recommending for the ECB to start cutting rates in June, six quarterly 25 basis point cuts, to reach neutral in September ‘25. But to be ready in terms of upside and downside risks to that forecast, and always look at totality of data. And one data point is if US policy rates are staying higher than expected, higher than expected in our baseline, when we are looking at that impact of higher policy rates, that will have positive inflation impulse for Europe, it is not negligible, but it's small. And you would expect that this is being dealt with when you look at the rate path on a meeting-by-meeting basis. And it will be one of the many elements which the ECB will need to take into account. But fundamentally that divergence, we do not expect to change this trajectory, which we have in the policy rate adjustment of the ECB. And certainly, it doesn't impact on the starting date of the gradual reduction in policy rates.\\n\\nWith regard to trade. So here we are a multilateral organization, and we have been preaching the benefits of this multilateral trade system. And so, frictions between countries are always there. And we are strongly recommending to all stakeholders to address that within that rules based international system, including through the WTO, and to have any actions on the trade side, on the subsidy side, be WTO consistent, because everybody will lose if we get into trade wars or into subsidy wars. And especially with regard to Europe. Europe is a very open economy. It benefits very much from that system. And when you're looking at the EU-China relationship, it is a very close one, with 9 percent of US exports, EU exports going to China, and Chinese sending 50 percent of their total exports to the EU. So we advocate to talk, to cooperate, but clearly, all parties need to stick to the rules and then apply also the arbitration and the processes we have in place when there is a perception that these rules are being broken.\\n\\nPÉREZ: We're running out of time. We're going to try to get to all of your questions. Let’s take the gentleman in the first row here, please.\\n\\nQUESTIONER: Hi, I wonder what is the IMF perspective on the Ukraine debt level? Does it have a capacity to service liabilities in the longer term? And the second question, does Ukraine have a capacity to serve its debt in the longer term? And what is your perspective on the risks that it will need restructuring its debt before the IMF and or other donors?\\n\\nPÉREZ: Let me see if there are any other questions on Ukraine. Let's take the lady on the third row.\\n\\nQUESTIONER: Good morning. I have a question regarding Ukraine's external trade with the European Union. We have just mentioned that trade protectionism may cause more bad rather than good, whereas the economy rules, they demand a freer trade. And we are currently having a clash with the blockade of the borders. And since after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the EU has eased the rules for Ukraine to trade more openly. But the trade is currently partly blocked due to the blockade. And my question is, have you counted how it has affected the trade volumes in the EU over the last year? And also has it somehow affected Europe's growth or maybe slower growth last year?\\n\\nPÉREZ: I think we have more questions. Let's take the gentleman.\\n\\nQUESTIONER: I also wanted to touch on Ukraine. What does the Fund think about the new stricter EU import controls on certain agricultural products from Ukraine? And secondly, in terms of seizing Russian state-owned assets, where does the Fund stand on that? Some argue that the risks to financial stability are overblown. So it would be good to get your view on that. Thank you.\\n\\nPÉREZ: Any other questions on Ukraine? KAMMER: First question with regard to Ukraine's debt and its sustainability. We have a Fund program in place which is very successfully implemented by the Ukrainian authorities. As part of that, one of the objectives is to have debt in Ukraine sustainable on a forward-looking basis, that requires fiscal adjustment, that requires the continuation of concessional financing, and that also requires a debt restructuring of the official sector and of private commercial claims. So the debt restructuring actually is not something which is a possibility. It is part of the toolset in order to achieve sustainable debt in Ukraine under the program.\\n\\nWith regards to the impact of trade from Ukraine to the EU, I don't have any particularly good numbers. But with regards to the other part, the restrictions which came up over the last few months in terms of imports into the EU from Ukraine, there we saw a response on the Ukrainian side. It meant lower tax customs revenue and it also impacted on growth in Ukraine. So there the effect was a negative one. I should also say, of course, the opening of the borders and freeing up of trade between Ukraine and the EU overall had a much more positive impact than these restrictions were negative.\\n\\nWith regards to the seizure of Russia's assets, on this particular issue, our view is that is something for the relevant jurisdictions and courts to determine and to decide. From our side what is important, that whatever action is taken, that the implications of the functioning of the International Monetary System are being taken into account. And our Managing Director recently emphasized that one needs to be wary of unintended consequences of these impacts. So I think that remains important for us. And again, this is the issue of a multilateral rules-based system and a well-functioning International Monetary and Financial system, which we all should be respectful for because it has delivered so many good things and prosperity over the last decades.\\n\\nPÉREZ: We're running out of time. I want to take the lady.\\n\\nQUESTIONER: Thanks, Camilla. This is from Koha News group in Kosovo. It's a small country, but according to the IMF, it has had 3.3 percent growth in 2010 to 23 and it has inflation levels much lower than in 2022. But this did not reflect in the ground, on the contrary. So the prices are the same and the salaries are the same apart from the public sector. And my question is, I mean, is 3.3 and this level of disinflation positive news, and how can it be explained as such to the people, to our audiences that did not feel it? And very shortly, I mean, you were talking about labor market. What we are facing now in Kosovo in these recent years is the number of working visas issued to our young, educated people from western countries. So the brain drain is growing exponentially. What would be your advice to Kosovo in order to stop this? Because, I mean, we miss them anyway. Thank you.\\n\\nKAMMER: On your first question, it probably also warrants a very general answer. And we don't want to be cold hearted when we say big success of policymakers, of dealing with these large shocks, the pandemic and the energy crisis in Europe, because that was a very painful exercise for the population. And that pain still sticks, including through high inflation, what we are seeing is always the counterfactual that it could have been a lot worse than what we are seeing. And so even when you are experiencing again a positive growth rates and when you are experiencing that inflation is declining, that pain still is there. And it will take time for that positive growth to be registered by the population and also the decline of inflation to be registered, especially when nominal wages are adjusting and clawing up and increasing the real purchasing power.\\n\\nAgain, with regards to Kosovo in particular, what we saw during the pandemic years, the decline in the poverty rate stopped, but it now has continued again. But again, whenever you look at these aggregates, it takes time for the population to register. And even when we say that inflation is back to target, that means price levels are higher and that's what the population is seeing on a day-to-day basis. And that's always a shocker. And that remains, despite having not a particular economic effect. Brain drain has been a big issue for the countries in the region. And the advice there is one, education is key, and skills are key for the population in order to bring jobs and employment there. So that is an important response. And then the other part is the bottom line is you need to increase productivity; you need to increase growth in order to generate the incomes people are seeking. And again, that means still hard structural reforms to undertake in many of the countries. And those in the end will provide the incentives for workers to stay or for workers to come back. There is no easy solution. That's the bottom line. And there is no quick solution in order to fix that brain drain.\\n\\nPÉREZ: So two more questions because we have to wrap up, taking the gentleman in the fourth, fifth row and then I think we missed one part of the questions on Italy on debt trajectory. So you can then tackle that one.\\n\\nQUESTIONER: Following the presidential elections in Turkey, Turkey has shifted to a more orthodox monetary policy under a new economic management. What are your thoughts on this policy shift and Turkey's outlook? And do you have confidence that this policy shifts will be durable? And if I may add a second one, there are some economists thinking that there is a need for a new IMF program in Turkey. Do you believe there is that need? And are there talks with Turkish authorities on this? Thank you.\\n\\nKAMMER: So what we saw in Turkey in mid-2023 was an absolute policy pivot. And the new policies in place on the monetary side with a substantial tightening, but also on the fiscal side with fiscal consolidation, which has started including to accommodate the increased earthquake spending, is indeed a completely different policy setting. We already see some achievements on this side. And it's not only on the disinflation side that will take longer to materialize fully, but vulnerabilities to Turkey have been decreased because of this policy setting. Now, I had a discussion with Minister Simsek yesterday and he pointed out that these reforms are in place. This is a longer-term program and he and the central bank will execute that program. And that program is expected to lower vulnerability further, to bring inflation down durably over time, and to also create that climate for investment to take place so that we have a shift in the growth pattern and the rebalancing of growth.\\n\\nOn your second question, first of all, we are very much supportive of the reform program in place, and that's also what we would be recommending to Turkey, what the economic team there is carrying out. And no, there's no discussion on any IMF program supporting Turkey.\\n\\nPÉREZ: Thank you. I believe there were two parts of the questions that we didn't tackle on Italy and perhaps one on Germany. From the lady on the third road, it was about slow growth in Germany. Do you want to start with Germany first? CELASUN: Sure. I can talk a little bit about our forecast for Germany. We still expect a modest and gradual recovery in Germany this year. It's going to be driven by the recovery in real wages, which will help private consumption recover. We have nonetheless trimmed our forecasts a little bit, both for this year and next. What we have seen is that in the first quarter, business and consumer confidence was surprisingly weak. We think that's because of the weak economic environment last year, which is weighed on public sentiment. But as real wages continue to pick up, we expect private consumption to gather momentum as well. And as we move into next year and 2026, the reduction in interest rates will also help lift investment. But looking further ahead into the medium term, the aging of the population is expected to weigh on the growth of potential output. So we are looking at pretty modest growth rates down the road. Thanks. PÉREZ: Two minutes for the debt trajectory in Italy. BERGER: So Italy, as you know, is a country with high public debt. It's currently at 137 percent and we think it will increase to 140 by the end of ‘25. So fiscal adjustment is important and the advantage of doing it rather sooner than later is that you get relief on the debt service side because there's just less debt to service going forward and interest rates are high. In addition, you will be rewarded by markets who see the credibility of the fiscal adjustment program manifest in actions where to start was your question. I think on the top of the list are tax credits, many of which are not very efficient as a mean to help Italy down the road in terms of productivity. The super bonus is one example. There are others. Other lower hanging fruits are loopholes in the tax base that can be closed that will bring revenue. And finally, there's still a number of cost-of-living support programs in the system that can also be withdrawn rather fast. That will help. And we think fast action is indeed required. PÉREZ: Thanks so much. Thanks, Helge, Alfred, Oya. Thank you all for joining.

You can sign up here for the weekly email newsletter Berlin Briefing.', 'Forecast for the German Economy\\n\\nThe leading indicators currently available do not point to an economic turnaround at the start of 2024: a deteriorating order situation in all economic sectors, low order backlogs, high sickness rates, ongoing strikes.\\n\\nAll in all, economic output is likely to continue its decline in the current quarter and fall by 0.1 percent compared to the previous quarter. A noticeable overall economic recovery is not expected until the second half of the year. Overall, price-adjusted gross domestic product will increase by only 0.2 percent this year compared to the previous year. Next year, economic output will then increase by 1.5 percent. The growth forecast for the current year has thus been significantly lowered by 0.7 percentage points compared to the ifo Economic Forecast Winter 2023 and raised slightly by 0.2 percentage points for 2025. Contrary to expectations, the German economy is in recession in the winter half-year 2023/24. In particular, a recovery in industrial activity will not set in until later.\\n\\nEconomic weakness will slow down employment growth and initially cause unemployment to rise further. The unemployment rate will average 5.9 percent this year, 0.2 percentage points higher than in 2023. The rate is not expected to fall back to 5.6 percent until 2025.\\n\\nThe inflation rate will continue to fall from an average of 5.9 percent last year to 2.3 percent this year and 1.6% percent next year. Gas and electricity prices in particular will become cheaper for consumers. The energy component is therefore likely to bring down inflation in the forecast period. The core inflation rate (i.e., the increase in consumer prices excluding energy) will decline more slowly and, at 2.8 percent this year and 2.2 percent next year, will be higher than the overall inflation rate. Inflation among labor-intensive service providers in particular will fall only slowly because rising wage costs are keeping up the pressure on prices.\\n\\nGermany’s budget deficit will fall to 1.8 percent and 1.0% percent of economic output this year and next year, respectively, down from 2.1 percent this year. The current account balance will fall to 6.6 percent of economic output by 2025.', 'The German government said Europe’s largest economy was in “troubled waters” and slashed its growth forecast for this year as it struggles with a lack of skilled labor, excessive bureaucracy, high interest rates and lagging investment in new projects — while a relatively modest set of tax breaks for business remains blocked in the legislature.\\n\\nThe growth forecast was lowered to 0.2% from the previous forecast from last fall of 1.3%. That would follow a shrinking of the economy by 0.3% for all of last year.\\n\\nGermany is recovering “more slowly than we hoped” from the shock of Russia cutting off most supplies of natural gas after its invasion of Ukraine, Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said as he presented the government’s annual economic report. “The economy is in troubled waters.”\\n\\nThe loss of Russian gas in Germany led to a spike in energy costs that hammered energy intensive industries and contributed to high consumer inflation that eroded purchasing power and made consumers more reluctant to spend. Those two headwinds have eased as inflation and oil and gas prices have fallen, and as wages have started to rise to make up for inflation and restore lost disposable real income.\\n\\nAnd unemployment remains low, meaning last year’s downturn does not resemble a classic recession.\\n\\n“The good news is, Putin failed in his attempt to drive Germany into an energy shortage and thus into an economic catastrophe,” Habeck said. As wages rise faster than inflation, workers “finally have more money in their wallets in real terms.”\\n\\nSlowing global trade is another factor behind Germany’s troubles, since exports of autos and industrial machinery have been mainstays of the economy.\\n\\nOther, often longer term problems continue to plague what used to be Europe’s industrial and export growth motor. High interest rates from the European Central Bank have slowed construction of new homes and offices; companies complain they can’t get skilled workers; and excessive red tape and lengthy approvals slow the construction of new projects such as renewable energy generation.\\n\\nInvestment in digital and transport infrastructure has lagged after the government focused on balancing budgets to avoid piling up new debt. A 2009 constitutional amendment limiting deficit spending has come back to haunt the current government after the constitutional court ruled it could not use special emergency funds to skirt deficit limits.\\n\\nThe coalition government led by Social Democratic Chancellor Olaf Scholz had to revise this year’s spending at the last minute, including cancelling a subsidy for agricultural diesel fuel. That has led to protests by farmers who have blocked roads with their tractors.\\n\\nA relatively modest set of tax breaks amounting to 3.2 billion euros ($3.5 billion) has passed the lower house but has been blocked by the conservative opposition in the upper house. Opposition leader Friedrich Merz’s Christian Democrats have made their approval conditional on restoring the farm fuel tax break.\\n\\nThe government has attempted to deal with the shortage of skilled labor by passing laws easing immigration for workers in needed fields and by shortening the wait to become a citizen from eight years to five, and three in some circumstances.', 'A three-year-old overhaul of the DAX index suite will mark a new chapter in the first quarter of 2024, when methodology changes for the indices will come into effect.\\n\\nAs of Monday, March 18, 2024, the DAX Equity Indices[1] will adopt new rules, mainly related to the treatment of corporate actions. Among other changes, the indices‘ calculation formula will also be revised, and the weight cap on constituents will be raised.\\n\\nThe biggest rules reform since the inception of DAX in 1988 was designed to bolster the quality of member companies and bring selection criteria in line with international standards, ensuring the indices remain fit for purpose in a changing financial landscape. This sustained evolution also saw the flagship DAX benchmark grow from 30 to 40 constituents in 2021. The new treatment of corporate actions will further benefit users by facilitating and lowering the cost of index replication.\\n\\nMethodology and calculation changes\\n\\nAs of March 2024, the DAX Equity Indices will be calculated under the STOXX calculation framework, triggering changes to the treatment of corporate actions.\\n\\nIn the most significant change, dividends will now be reinvested in the whole index portfolio rather than in the distributing stock. There will also be changes to the treatment of shares that are subject to a tender offer, benefiting investors with a clearer process timeline that makes the index more predictable. Further changes will be implemented to the determination of stocks’ free floats, as well as the threshold for extraordinary free float adjustments.\\n\\nAdditionally, the index calculation formula will move from a so-called correction factor-based methodology to a divisor-based scheme. Consequently, changes in the number of shares due to corporate actions will be reflected immediately rather than carried over to the next regular index review.\\n\\nFor a detailed list and explanation of all rules and calculations changes, please click on the documents below:\\n\\nData system migration: standardization and accessibility\\n\\nAnother key change in the DAX world will also take place next March, when the distribution of data for DAX Equity Indices will migrate to the system currently used by STOXX indices. This will ensure a better operational experience for subscribers of both DAX and STOXX data, offering single-point access to reports that are aligned in structure and content. STOXX constantly upgrades its platforms to match markets’ and clients’ demand for integrity, governance, surveillance and stability.\\n\\nTo create a smooth transition and help DAX index licensees familiarize themselves with the new Index Data Distribution System, STOXX will run a simulation phase between December 18, 2023, and February 29, 2024, during when it will release daily DAX data reports on the new system alongside the existing one (MD+S).\\n\\nOnly test data will be released over the new distribution system during the simulation period. Real data will remain available only on the incumbent system until the end of February.\\n\\nFurther information on the new distribution system and files format is available in the following documents:\\n\\nOngoing evolution\\n\\nThe work to modernize the DAX indices isn’t over, as STOXX continues to meet investors’ progressing needs and demands. Following a market consultation, STOXX announced on November 22 that the DAX indices’ weight cap for individual constituents will be raised from 10% to 15% as of March 2024, reflecting “a wide range of considerations from different stakeholders” and aligning the index with international practices.\\n\\n[1] For a complete list of impacted indices, please click here.', 'Germany is headed toward a technical recession, but the DAX, its blue-chip stock index, is on a streak of record highs. So why are German stocks doing much better than sentiment on the ground?\\n\\nGermany\\'s benchmark blue-chip stock index topped 18,000 points for the first time during trading on Wednesday morning, hitting 18,000.42 shortly after opening.\\n\\nThe DAX, which is made up of 40 large publicly traded German corporations, has been on a strong run in recent days despite struggles for the overall German economy.\\n\\nThe trend is a rare piece of positive money news out of Germany as of late. A few weeks ago, Germany\\'s economy minister, Robert Habeck, revised the country\\'s growth expectations for 2024, lowering the forecast from 1.3% to 0.2%.\\n\\n\"The fact that the global economic environment is unstable and global trade growth is historically low is a challenge for an export nation like Germany,\" Habeck said.\\n\\nThe German Bundesbank, the country\\'s central bank, had also announced that economic output in Germany was set to fall again slightly in the first quarter of 2024, pushing the country into a technical recession , which is defined as two quarters of negative growth. The bank cited widespread strikes as a key contributing factor.\\n\\nMany companies on Germany\\'s DAX index have little exposure to the local economy, experts say Image: Silas Stein/dpa/picture alliance\\n\\nDAX has little exposure to Germany\\n\\nLike elsewhere, Germany has been plagued by high inflation, leaving consumers strapped for cash. Industrial orders and production in the export nation have also fallen, and surveys show German companies increasingly pessimistic about the year ahead.\\n\\n\"Companies are still pretty uncertain about the situation and what they can expect for the upcoming years,\" Lara Zarges, an economist at Germany\\'s ifo Institute for Economic Research, told DW.\\n\\nSo why the investor optimism?\\n\\n\"Ironically, I think there\\'s a strong argument to make for an inverse correlation between economic performance and stock market performance,\" Ben Ritchie, head of developed market equities at investment company abrdn, told DW.\\n\\nCurrently, the index is on course for the longest record streak since 2015.\\n\\n\"The revenues for these companies aren\\'t in Germany,\" Ritchie said. \"So the German economy doesn\\'t matter.\"\\n\\nDespite troubles at home, investors are optimistic about how Germany\\'s biggest companies will perform Image: Christin Klose/dpa/picture alliance\\n\\nSMEs don\\'t share the optimism\\n\\nThe retail customers and production sites for these large, international companies are primarily located outside of Germany. Ritchie says the health of those markets, along with structural developments within specific industries and companies, has a far greater influence on DAX performance than the domestic economy does.\\n\\nHowever, according to Zarges, that\\'s not the case for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Germany, which employ over 50% of the country\\'s workforce but aren\\'t represented in the DAX index.\\n\\n\"These companies also participate in global supply chains, of course, but they face the problem that wages here in Germany have risen.

High coronavirus relief spending and low energy costs there have helped boost consumer spending.\\n\\nCooling inflation is likely bolstering investor sentiment, too. Consumer price growth has eased significantly in many countries, Germany included.

If the trend keeps up, lower interest rates are likely to follow.\\n\\nThe high borrowing cost introduced to curb inflation was a blow to both retail and corporate investing as well as consumer spending. But investors now appear optimistic that cash will soon be flowing more freely through the economy and that this will boost corporate profits.\\n\\nAnd some think the sluggish domestic economy could be a good thing.\\n\\nFor Germany\\'s largest companies, a weak German economy could lead to a cheaper euro as well as lower borrowing costs as the ECB tries to stimulate spending in Europe. At the same time, stagnation would have little impact on revenues due to their large overseas markets.\\n\\n\"I actually think that the biggest bull case for Europe is an increasingly stagnant domestic economy,\" Ritchie said.\\n\\nEdited by: Uwe Hessler']\n"
